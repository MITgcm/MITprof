Welcome to MITprof's documentation!
===================================

.. Ocean Profile Data Collections In Matlab And Octave.

Here, you will learn about the `MITprof` toolbox that provides a framework to
standardize, manipulate, and analyze ocean profile data collections (e.g., those
shown below) in Matlab and Octave.
It was originally developed as part the `ECCO version 4` framework along with
the companion `gcmfaces` toolbox that handles gridded Earth variables in
generic fashion :cite:`for-eta:15`.

.. This user manual provides an installation guide for `gcmfaces` and `MITprof`
.. (:numref:`install`), a documentation of the basic `gcmfaces` features
.. (:numref:`features`), and an overview of higher-level `gcmfaces` functionalities
.. for mapping, transport, etc. operations (:numref:`demo` and :numref:`standard`).
